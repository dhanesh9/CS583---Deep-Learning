# CS583-Deep-Learning

**Introduction**

This repository contains the code and Jupyter notebooks submitted for the Deep Learning course offered at the Stevens Institute of Technology. As a Masters student, I took this course to pursue my interest in Deep Learning, as well as other Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence topics.

**Usage**

To use the contents of this repository, you will need the following software:

Python 3
TensorFlow with Keras
Jupyter
You can install Python 3 through your package manager, and TensorFlow, Keras, and Jupyter can be installed using Python's package management system. Here's an example command to install them using pip:
"pip install tensorflow keras jupyter"
        
**Relevant Sources**

During the development of my assignments, I utilized Google's Colab platform. It provides the ability to run Jupyter notebooks with GPU or TPU support in the cloud, which was beneficial for experimenting with deep learning models. The platform offers a convenient and efficient environment for developing and training models.
